✈️ AeroGuide – Airport Ground Operations & Passenger Flow Explainer Bot
AeroGuide is a Generative AI–powered chatbot designed to help passengers clearly understand airport ground operations and passenger flow.
It explains complex airport procedures in simple, easy-to-understand language, reducing confusion and improving the overall travel experience.

🚩 Problem Statement
Airport procedures such as check-in, security screening, boarding, and baggage claim are often confusing—especially for first-time flyers, senior citizens, and international travelers.
